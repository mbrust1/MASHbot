# MASHbot

Welcome to MASHbot! MASHbot was created as an interactive way to play MASH (Mansion, Apartment, Shack, House). It was created as my final assignment for SE575 Software Design.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have node.js installed. If you do not, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). To check, use:

```
node -v
```
To run the bot, you'll need the Bot Framework Emulator. Download the appropriate version for your machine of the 4.1.0 release from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases).

### Installing
Navigate to the cloned repo.

Install botbuilder package:

```
npm install --save botbuilder
```

Install restify package:

```
npm install --save restify
```

Run app:
```
node app.js
```
Once the app is running, open the Bot Framework Emulator. Click on Open Bot and choose the MASHbot bot file. When it opens you'll be ready to chat with MASHbot!
